Automated Door Control System, Prepared by Taher Mohamed.
-The system asks the user to enter the Password using the keypad.
-The user has only 3 attempts to enter the password, 
 after that the door is closed and the alarm system will fire (the buzzer and the LED).
-In case the user enters a correct password, the door will open.
